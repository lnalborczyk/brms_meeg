  abstract = {Electrophysiological research with event-related brain potentials (ERPs) is increasingly moving from simple, strictly orthogonal stimulation paradigms towards more complex, quasi-experimental designs and naturalistic situations that involve fast, multisensory stimulation and complex motor behavior. As a result, electrophysiological responses from subsequent events often overlap with each other. In addition, the recorded neural activity is typically modulated by numerous covariates, which influence the measured responses in a linear or non-linear fashion. Examples of paradigms where systematic temporal overlap variations and low-level confounds between conditions cannot be avoided include combined electroencephalogram (EEG)/eye-tracking experiments during natural vision, fast multisensory stimulation experiments, and mobile brain/body imaging studies. However, even “traditional,” highly controlled ERP datasets often contain a hidden mix of overlapping activity (e.g., from stimulus onsets, involuntary microsaccades, or button presses) and it is helpful or even necessary to disentangle these components for a correct interpretation of the results. In this paper, we introduce               unfold               , a powerful, yet easy-to-use MATLAB toolbox for regression-based EEG analyses that combines existing concepts of massive univariate modeling (“regression-ERPs”), linear deconvolution modeling, and non-linear modeling with the generalized additive model into one coherent and flexible analysis framework. The toolbox is modular, compatible with EEGLAB and can handle even large datasets efficiently. It also includes advanced options for regularization and the use of temporal basis functions (e.g., Fourier sets). We illustrate the advantages of this approach for simulated data as well as data from a standard face recognition experiment. In addition to traditional and non-conventional EEG/ERP designs,               unfold               can also be applied to other overlapping physiological signals, such as pupillary or electrodermal responses. It is available as open-source software at               http://www.unfoldtoolbox.org               .},

  abstract = {Abstract             ERP experiments generate massive datasets, often containing thousands of values for each participant, even after averaging. The richness of these datasets can be very useful in testing sophisticated hypotheses, but this richness also creates many opportunities to obtain effects that are statistically significant but do not reflect true differences among groups or conditions (bogus effects). The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how common and seemingly innocuous methods for quantifying and analyzing ERP effects can lead to very high rates of significant but bogus effects, with the likelihood of obtaining at least one such bogus effect exceeding 50\% in many experiments. We focus on two specific problems: using the grand‐averaged data to select the time windows and electrode sites for quantifying component amplitudes and latencies, and using one or more multifactor statistical analyses. Reanalyses of prior data and simulations of typical experimental designs are used to show how these problems can greatly increase the likelihood of significant but bogus results. Several strategies are described for avoiding these problems and for increasing the likelihood that significant effects actually reflect true differences among groups or conditions.},

The hierarchical GAM (HGAM), allows modeling of nonlinear functional relationships between covariates and outcomes where the shape of the function itself varies between different grouping levels. We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted using existing GAM software, the               mgcv               package in R. We also discuss computational and statistical issues with fitting these models, and demonstrate how to fit HGAMs on example data.

  abstract = {Abstract             Gaussian processes are powerful non-parametric probabilistic models for stochastic functions. However, the direct implementation entails a complexity that is computationally intractable when the number of observations is large, especially when estimated with fully Bayesian methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo. In this paper, we focus on a low-rank approximate Bayesian Gaussian processes, based on a basis function approximation via Laplace eigenfunctions for stationary covariance functions. The main contribution of this paper is a detailed analysis of the performance, and practical recommendations for how to select the number of basis functions and the boundary factor. Intuitive visualizations and recommendations, make it easier for users to improve approximation accuracy and computational performance. We also propose diagnostics for checking that the number of basis functions and the boundary factor are adequate given the data. The approach is simple and exhibits an attractive computational complexity due to its linear structure, and it is easy to implement in probabilistic programming frameworks. Several illustrative examples of the performance and applicability of the method in the probabilistic programming language Stan are presented together with the underlying Stan model code.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Localising effects in space, time and other dimensions is a fundamental goal of magneto‐ and electroencephalography (EEG) research. A popular exploratory approach applies mass‐univariate statistics followed by cluster‐sum inferences, an effective way to correct for multiple comparisons while preserving high statistical power by pooling together neighbouring effects. Yet, these cluster‐based methods have an important limitation: each cluster is associated with a unique               p               ‐value, such that there is no error control at individual timepoints, and one must be cautious about interpreting when and where effects start and end. Sassenhagen and Draschkow (2019) provided an important reminder of this limitation. They also reported results from a simulation, suggesting that onsets estimated from EEG data are both positively biased and very variable. However, the simulation lacked comparisons to other methods. Here, I report such comparisons in a new simulation, replicating the positive bias of the cluster‐sum method, but also demonstrating that it performs relatively well, in terms of bias and variability, compared to other methods that provide pointwise               p               ‐values: two methods that control the false discovery rate and two methods that control the familywise error rate (cluster‐depth and maximum statistic methods). I also present several strategies to reduce estimation bias, including group calibration, group comparison and using binary segmentation, a simple change point detection algorithm that outperformed mass‐univariate methods in simulations. Finally, I demonstrate how to generate onset hierarchical bootstrap confidence intervals that integrate variability over trials and participants, a substantial improvement over standard group approaches that ignore measurement uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Abstract           Typically, event-related brain responses are calculated invariant to the underlying event duration, even in cases where event durations observably vary: with reaction times, fixation durations, word lengths, or varying stimulus durations. Additionally, an often co-occurring consequence of differing event durations is a variable overlap of the responses to subsequent events. While the problem of overlap e.g. in fMRI and EEG is successfully addressed using linear deconvolution, it is unclear whether deconvolution and duration covariate modeling can be jointly used, as both are dependent on the same inter-event-distance variability. Here, we first show that failing to explicitly account for event durations can lead to spurious results and thus are important to consider. Next, we propose and compare several methods based on multiple regression to explicitly account for stimulus durations. Using simulations, we find that non-linear spline regression of the duration effect outperforms other candidate approaches. Finally, we show that non-linear event duration modeling is compatible with linear overlap correction in time, making it a flexible and appropriate tool to model overlapping brain signals. This allows us to reconcile the analysis of stimulus responses with e.g. condition-biased reaction times, condition-biased stimulus duration, or fixation-related activity with condition-biased fixation durations. While in this paper we focus on EEG analyses, these findings generalize to LFPs, fMRI BOLD-responses, pupil dilation responses, and other overlapping signals.},
