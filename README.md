# Modelling M/EEG data with Bayesian nonparametric multilevel models

Time-resolved electrophysiological measurements such as those offered by magneto- or electro-encephalography (M/EEG) provide a unique window onto neural activity underlying cognitive process and how they unfold over time. Typically, we are interested in testing whether such measures differ across conditions and/or groups. The conventional approach consists in conducting mass-univariate statistics followed by some form of multiplicity correction (e.g., FDR, FWER) or cluster-based inference. However, these cluster-based methods have an important downside: they shift the focus of inference from the timepoint to the cluster level, thus preventing any conclusion to be made about the onset and offset of effects (e.g., differences across conditions). Here, we introduce a novel *model-based approch* for analysing one-dimensional M/EEG timeseries such as ERPs or decoding timecourses and their differences across conditions. This approach relies on Bayesian nonparametric multilevel modelling (multilevel generalised additive models or Gaussian processes), which outputs posterior probabililities of the effect being above chance at every timestep/voxel, while naturally taking into account the temporal dependencies and between-subject variability present in such data.
